# Choose Your Own Board Game

## What

A [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) app designed to help me:

1. Showcase the wonderfully diverse world of board games
2. Match people with board games based on their preferences

## Why

I love board games and I love introducing new people to the hobby.

Recently, my non-gamer[^1] friend Kirsty ([@LEWIK140](https://github.com/LEWIK140)) asked to play some board games with me.
With so many options available, I wanted to find board games that she would really enjoy.
To that end, I quickly hacked together this noddy web app so we can choose the board games to play together.

## Disclaimers

1. I use the term _'board game'_ as a catch-all for any (mostly) analogue game typically played on a table.
Controversially, this might include collectable card games (CCGs), tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), and miniatures games.
Nothing is off the table, so to speak.
2. Board games exemplify human creativity and innovation, making categorising them inherently challenging and subjective. Consequently, expect inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and opinions to differ.
3. I had very limited free time to work on this project, so expect an MVP with minimal features and polish.
4. I am not a front-end developer, so expect a buggy UI from the dot-com era.

## Usage

To use the app effectively, follow these steps:

1. Pour beverage of choice
2. Sit with non-gamer friend in front of a screen
3. Open the app and guide them through a thoughtful selection process
4. Make recommendations based on their preferences
5. Use [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) to show them images and more information
6. Play the board games they'll most enjoy

## v2.0

Recommendations are based on my personal opinions and experiences.
And while I enjoy putting my knowledge of board games to the test, future versions of the app could fetch data from [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) to automatically populate available options and generate recommendations.

Automated tests, a REST API, and an improved UI/UX would also be nice.
